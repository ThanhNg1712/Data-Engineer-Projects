# Project 1: RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis
* This projectgoes with:
  1. [Python note book](https://github.com/ThanhNg1712/Data-Engineer-Projects/blob/main/RFM_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb) includes:
      1. Data engineering: Checking, Cleaning missing data, Check classes Balancing
      2. Build classification models: Using clustering to group customer segments, find the optimal number of clusters base on Kmean innertias
      3. RFM analysis: R(Recency), F(Frequency), M(monetary)
         Base on the time customer make a purchase, frequency of making purchases and revunue of an order, we can group customer into three segments: 
         Low Value, Mid Value, High Value base on the total score = R + F + M. The scores are labels that are classified using Kmeans
      5. Visualization
